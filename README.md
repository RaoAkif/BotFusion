# BotFusion

## Overview

BotFusion is a robust solution designed to provide well-structured, Markdown-formatted answers to user queries. This project is inspired by [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai) and features capabilities such as content scraping from websites, mitigating hallucinations through citation of sources, and rate-limiting to enhance scalability and usability.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the project running on your local machine:

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raoakif/botfusion.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd botfusion
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and populate it with the following keys:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=""
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=""
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=""
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual API credentials.

### Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the application.

## Features

- **Query Handling:** Users can input queries, including URLs, and receive context-rich, Markdown-formatted answers.
- **Content Scraping:** Scrapes web pages using Puppeteer and Cheerio to extract relevant content.
- **Rate Limiting:** Ensures a smooth user experience by limiting excessive requests with Upstash Redis.
- **Source Citation:** Mitigates hallucinations by providing sources for generated answers.

## Core Files and TODOs

The key areas to focus on in the codebase include:

### 1. `src/app/page.tsx`
- Update the chat interface to display user and AI responses.
- Handle API responses dynamically.

### 2. `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- Implement the chat API using Groq for LLM integration.
- Add web scraping capabilities with Puppeteer and Cheerio.

### 3. `src/middleware.ts`
- Implement rate-limiting logic with Upstash Redis.

## Challenges to Explore

- Extend content scraping to handle various data sources, such as:
  - YouTube videos
  - PDFs
  - CSV files
  - Images
- Add data visualization capabilities (e.g., bar charts, line charts, histograms).
- Implement a hierarchical web crawler to identify and scrape content from relevant links on a page.

## API Keys

- Ensure to configure necessary API keys in `.env` for services like OpenAI, Upstash, and others.
